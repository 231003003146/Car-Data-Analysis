# 🚗 Car Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a car dataset to understand how different vehicle attributes such as origin, horsepower, weight, cylinders, and mileage affect fuel efficiency.

The goal of this project is to clean the data, analyze key relationships, and extract meaningful insights using Python.
